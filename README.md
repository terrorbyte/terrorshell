TerrorShell
===========

The TerrorShell is an attempt to bring bash back into the main spotlight for customizability and ease of use. We took all the best parts from zsh, csh, oh-my-zsh, and some personal inspiration and tried to create a simple bash configuration that would allow some advanced features.

Features
========

* Sane Defaults: By default TerrorShell will make bash much easier to use, prettier, and hopefully quicker.
* Package Manager Wrapper: Sometimes you don't want to have to remember which distro (or package manager) is on the computer you're using, with TerrorShell its as simple as 'install ' and the rest will be handled for you. See the wrapper documentation. TODO
* Git Integration: One of the things you hear about a lot is shells having integration with Git and other source management systems.
* Aliases: We attempted to try and create some of the best built in bash aliases to make your life that much easier (or quicker). See alias documentation. TODO
* Modules: Tack in your new module (maybe SVN directory integration) into the .bashrc modules variable.
* Installer / Updater: Stay up to date in a non-intrusive way. The updates are up to you.
* Per-directory Commands: Sometimes you are in a specific directory you might need different aliases or scripts.
